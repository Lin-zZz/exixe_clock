exixe clock is a GNSS-aided high precision Nixie tube clock. With the antenna connected and GPS fix obtained, displayed time will be within 90 nanoseconds of the atomic clocks onboard GPS satellites.

exixe clock makes use of the exixe modules, and works with both IN-14 and IN-12 tubes with the same PCB.

light sensor for auto brightness
touch sensor for touch control
SD card reader for logging
temp sensor to display temp
uart header for extension
